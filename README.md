#### Description:

AI Resume Analyzer is a Python-based project that uses **Streamlit** and **OpenAI GPT models** to evaluate resumes and provide constructive, job-specific feedback.  

The application allows users to upload resumes in **PDF** or **TXT** format and optionally enter a **target job role**. The AI then reviews the resume, highlighting strengths, identifying gaps, and offering actionable recommendations for improvement.  

The goal of this project is to help job seekers strengthen their resumes and increase their chances of landing interviews by leveraging natural language AI and a simple, interactive interface.
